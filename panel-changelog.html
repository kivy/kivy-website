Highlights
==========

Python 3.5/3.6+ support on Windows
----------------------------------

Python 3.5+ support is finally here for Windows using the same codebase! These versions are currently only supported with Visual Studio 2015. We also provide self-contained wheels for them. See https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-windows.html#installation.

Kivy Clock
----------

The Kivy Clock has been moved to cython to improve performance [#4412]. Even better, scheduling is now deterministic and will always execute callbacks in the order they were scheduled. Finally, all Clock scheduling and unscheduling is now thread-safe. To get the best out of this, the recommended pattern is to save Clock events and later call their cancel method instead of calling the inefficient Clock.unschedule() method. We also added multiple new Clock types for advanced users [#4436].

Graphics
--------

[#4343, #4385, #3906] The graphics backends have been refactored. Graphics modules now call the central `kivy.graphics.cgl` subpackage for all OpenGL calls instead of direct API calls. The `cgl` package can switch between multiple GL backends on each platform at startup-time based on the `KIVY_GL_BACKEND` variable (https://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.graphics.cgl.html#module-kivy.graphics.cgl).

Available backends are (gl, sdl2) on unix and (glew, sdl2, angle_sdl2) on windows. When no GL is available, the mock backend which is a NOOP backend can be used to when compiling Kivy e.g. to run tests. Further, `KIVY_GL_DEBUG=1` is used to force all GL calls to be logged.

With the addition of the angle_sdl2 backend for windows, Kivy now supports environments with no or old OpenGL drivers as long as they have Direct3D 9+ support.

New Widgets
-----------

  - [#4108] RecycleView has been merged from garden and with new and improved API. It's now fully integrated with layouts and can be used in place of e.g. BoxLayout or GridLayout. See https://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.uix.recycleview.html and the PR for examples.
  - [#3900] CoverBehavior, similar to CSS cover, has been added to be used with images. It ensures that the image is sized so that it is as small as possible while ensuring that both dimensions are greater than or equal to the corresponding size of the widget.

New features
------------

  - [#4617] Add size_hint_min/max to widgets. Widgets that use size hints can now specify the maximum and minimum size of the widget and it'll be respected by the layouts (https://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.uix.widget.html#kivy.uix.widget.Widget.size_hint_min_x).
  - Many new Window features for sdl2, see that section below.

Deprecations
------------

In light of RecycleView being added, ListView and its associated adaptors are being deprecated and slated to be removed in the next release:

- AbstractView (kivy.uix.abstractview)
- Adapters (kivy.adapters)
- DictAdapter (kivy.adapters.dictadapter)
- ListAdapter (kivy.adapters.listadapter)
- List Item View Argument Converters (kivy.adapters.args_converter)
- ListView (kivy.uix.listview)
- SelectableDataItem (kivy.adapters.models)
- SelectableView (kivy.uix.selectableview)
- SimpleListAdapter (kivy.adapters.simplelistadapter)

Other:

- Interactive launcher (kivy.interactive)

Breaking changes
----------------

- [#3891] ButtonBehavior.always_release defaults to False, so by default a release outside the button is ignored.
- [#4132] ButtonBehavior.MIN_STATE_TIME was removed and instead has been added to the config. Each button and dropdown now has their own configurable min_state_time property that defaults to the config value.
- [#4168] kivy.metrics.metrics was removed, use kivy.metrics.Metrics instead.
- [#4211] TextInput.background_disabled_active was removed, the normal background is used instead.
- [#4254] kivy.utils.platform is now a string describing the platform and not a callable.
- [#4603] Made App.on_pause default to return True.
- [#4819] Remove kivy module extension support - it wasn't used.
- [#4224] Remove pygst (audio, video, camera), gi (audio, video) and videocapture (camera) providers. Use gstplayer or ffpyplayer instead (https://kivy.org/docs/guide/environment.html#restrict-core-to-specific-implementation)
- [#5011, #4828] added support for opencv 2 and 3 (camera)
- [#5033] Clock trigger call doesn’t return True (or anything) anymore, use `is_triggered` instead.
- [#5088] Change the auto scale option in BorderImage from bool to string with multiple scaling options.

Installation
------------

- To reduce the Kivy install size, the Kivy examples have been split from the main Windows wheels and should now be installed manually if desired using `pip install kivy_examples`.

- [#4392] Fallback with pkg-config to search both for gstreamer and sdl2 if frameworks are not installed on macOS.
