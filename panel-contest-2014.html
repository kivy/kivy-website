<h1>Kivy Programming Contest #2</h1>

It's time for Kivy's second programming contest, a chance for Kivy
users both new and old to show off their skills and compete for
awesome prizes. Competing programs will be judged on a range of
criteria, so don't be afraid to dive in!

The theme of this contest is <em>education</em>. This is a broad
theme, you could make anything from a maths game, to a handwriting
tutor, to a turtle graphics toy...or anything else you can imagine.

Registration will open 2 weeks before the official start date, but you
can enter any time up to the final deadline. Give it a go!

<h2>Call for Sponsors</h2>

We're currently looking for more sponsors to help make this contest
even bigger and better! Sponsorship is possible at a range of tiers
with different levels of interaction and benefits to your organisation.

Interested parties are invited to contact us for more information.

<h2>Rules</h2>

These rules are a general guideline, exact rules and terms will be
posted before the contest starts.

The goal is to show the world some of the great things that be built
quickly with Kivy while having fun, and to give more people an
opportunity to try Kivy's cool features. The general guidelines are:

<ul>
  <li>Keep it family friendly.</li>
  <li>Make it fun and attractive, show how your Kivy app can stand out from the crowd.</li>
  <li>Entries can be from individuals or from teams.</li>
  <li>No prior code - build your full app during the competition month.</li>
  <li>Don't forget the theme of education!</li>
</ul>

The following are the specific requirements for your
applications, relating to how they will be tested and judged.

<ol class="rules">
  <li>
	You the participant (individual or team) must create an app with
	the education theme. Don't feel constrained, you can make
	anything with this general theme...be creative!
  </li>
  <li>
    You officially enter the contest using the application form,
    which we'll open on April 2nd. You can enter at any time up
    until the deadline, but the earlier the better!
  </li>
  <li>
	You must submit the game developed using Kivy by uploading it to a
	public Github repository before the official deadline, and
	including your repository name in your official entry. Don't leave
	this until the last day!  It's easy to
	<a href="http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect">setup Git</a> and
	<a href="http://help.github.com/create-a-repo/">create a repository with your code in it</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
	You can use Kivy and standard python libraries. Use of
	external Python libraries is also tolerated provided they are
	either pure python and available via pip, or have pre-existing
	recipes in Kivy's build tools for the platforms you are
	targeting.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can target specific platforms or hardware features, but must
    include clear setup instructions in your README. Regardless,
    we encourage taking advantage of Kivy's cross-platform potential
    rather than writing for a specific platform.
  </li>
  <li>
	You must respect the standard
	Kivy <a href="http://kivy.org/docs/guide/basic.html#create-an-application">Application
	  layout</a> as defined in Kivy documentation, and marks will be
	given for following good Kivy and Python conventions.
	The game must run on latest stable Kivy (1.8.0), with the
	command "<code>python main.py</code>".
  </li>
  <li>
	Usage of custom OpenGL is not allowed. Your application must be
	compatible OpenGL ES 2.0.
  </li>
  <li>
	The game should be tested before hand. A failure to start will result in
	negative points.
  </li>
  <li>
	Any adult or offensive content is <u>forbidden</u>. The game should be child friendly.
  </li>
  <li>
	Entries will be scored and prizes awarded by Panel of judges who are
	excluded from participating. Scoring will be based on several criteria as defined below.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your app will be scored based on the version in its official
    repository at the instant of the deadline.
  </li>
  <li>
	Your can choose the license for your program, but we strongly
	encourage using an open source license so others can change, share
	and learn from your code. Our only requirement is that your Github
	repository be public so that we can test and judge your entry.
  </li>
</ol>

Every entry will be scored with a mark out of 20 for each of the
following criteria. The best entries are generally those that do well
in all of these:

<ul>
  <li>Idea (funny/addictive, originality/uniqueness)</li>
  <li>Smooth gameplay (stutters, hiccups, game logic)</li>
  <li>Simplicity / usability</li>
  <li>Good use of Kivy logic and general style</li>
  <li>Production quality (graphics, sound, polish)</li>
</ul>
